# Predicting Credit Card Approvals with Logistic Regression

In this project we are going to build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm, to predict whether a request for a credit card gets rejected or approved. There are various factors determining the result of a credict card request, namely high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. We are going to use all these features to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning.

## Project Outline
- First, we will start off by loading and viewing the dataset.
- We will see that the dataset has a mixture of both numerical and non-numerical features, that it contains values from different ranges, plus that it contains a number of missing entries.
- We will have to preprocess the dataset to ensure the machine learning model we choose can make good predictions.
- After our data is in good shape, we will do some exploratory data analysis to build our intuitions.
- Finally, we will build a machine learning model that can predict if an individual's application for a credit card will be accepted.
