# Predicting Credit Card Approvals with Logistic Regression

In this project we are going to build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm, to predict whether a request for a credit card gets rejected or approved. There are various factors determining the result of a credict card request, namely high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. We are going to use all these features to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning.
