# Predicting Credit Card Approvals with Logistic Regression

In this project we are going to build a Machine Learning model using the Logistic Regression algorithm, to predict whether a request for a credit card gets rejected or approved. There are various factors determining the result of a credict card request, namely high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report. We are going to use all these features to build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning.

## Project Tasks
1. Credit card applications
2. Inspecting the applications
3. Splitting the dataset into train and test sets
4. Handling the missing values (part i)
5. Handling the missing values (part ii)
6. Handling the missing values (part iii)
7. Preprocessing the data (part i)
8. Preprocessing the data (part ii)
9. Fitting a logistic regression model to the train set
10. Making predictions and evaluating performance
11. Grid searching and making the model perform better
12. Finding the best performing model
